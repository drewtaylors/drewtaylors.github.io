    <p>
        I'm going to keep this one short and sweet. And yes, once again, I'm watching something.
        This time "American Horror Story". It's weird but good, if you haven't watched it, try it sometime.

    <p>
        Today, I *fingers crossed* finished my first PR into Solana's github repo <a href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana">see here</a>.
        It's a PR for a `close-vote-account` option in the CLI.
        I know, riveting stuff, but the circumstances in which I ended up here are what I think interesting enough.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was trying to set up a Solana validator on one of my computers and after a failed attempt opening up various ports on my router, which reminds me I need to remove right now... 
        Okay, done. Anyways, I decided running a validator was not going to be profitable as I needed good enough hardware to attract stakeholders.
        So I ended up stopping it, and lo and behold could not retrieve all of the Solana out of my vote account (a whopping $50 worth too).
    </p>

    <p>
        After looking around Solana's website for answers on how to retrieve my SOL, I remembered official Solana Discord I had joined awhile back thanks to Sonia's friend, Amar.
        Posting in the validator section I asked if it was possible to get my $50 back and someone by the name of @mvines responded!
        They told me I *just* needed to go in and modify Solana's code and build it locally in order to achieve what I desired.
        Like every naive programmer, I jumped in immediately without giving it much thought and amazingly enough, got my $50 back!
    </p>

    <p>
        @mvines and I had some back and forth conversation and he suggested that this would be a cool feature in the CLI to which I agreed.
        $50 is important to many and with a ~0.025 SOL being the vote account minimum, this value will only increase in USD as SOL's price goes up.
        Under the direction of @mvines, I came up with a much more built out solution (checks if there is active stake on the voting account) and discovered that @mvines is the #1 contributor to Solana's repo.
        I mean, what are the odds??? I was conversing and being taught by the #1 contributor for Solana, let alone the reason why is because he helped me get my $50 back.
        And to this, I'm extremely appreciative of his kindness and helpfulness. So thanks @mvines, this entry is to you.

        I said I was going to keep this short and sweet... but here I am.
        Anyways, I'm trying to learn more about web3.js.
        It is the client-side (frontend) framework that interacts directly with blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana.
        For those interested in a link to the tutorial, you can find it <a href="https://learn.figment.io/pathways/solana-pathway">here</a>.

        And with that, I think I'm signing off. Going to commit this and finish up some of this before hitting the hay tonight. Peace.
