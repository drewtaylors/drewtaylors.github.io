        <h2>Starting Off with JavaScript</h2>

        <p>
            Long time, no see! And to be completely honest, I am only here because I am procrastinating looking into minting NFTs on Solana.
            For those interested, I am using <a href="https://app.buildspace.so/home">buildspace</a> as a guide.
            Extremely helpful site which goes over Ethereum and Solana as well as a couple other blockchains.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I really came here for is to attempt JS in the Github home page...
            Before we begin, I should preface this by saying if you wanted to start building a frontend - this is now the industry standard.
            In industry, most people would launch an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> project 
            (I prefer React but it is completely preference - there are also other frameworks such as NextJS but I won't delve into the details).
            But I'm here to write simple Javascript and eventually CSS (if you couldn't tell from this barren HTML page).
            Without further ado, let's get started...
        </p>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            alert("This alert box was called with the onload event");
        </script>
    </body>
