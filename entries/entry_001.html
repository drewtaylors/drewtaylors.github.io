    <h1>Entry 1</h1>
    <h3>September 11th, 2021</h3>

    <p>
        So here it goes, the first entry to a journey that has already begun.
        As I sit here watching "The Big Lebowski", I've felt inspired to start writing about my software engineering journey.
        And this by no means is meant to be a guide to any specific material but serves more of as a track record of my interests over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I guess I should start with a little intro then...
    </p>

    <p>
        My name is Drew Taylor. I'm a software engineer over at Fisker Inc., an electric automotive company.
        As of the time of this writing, we are a little over a year out before releasing our first car, the Fisker Ocean, in November 2022.
        I was the first software engineer hired and have been working on the cloud portion since its inception.

        Going back a little further, I was born and raised in Mountain View, California.
        Many people know about Mountain View because of Google and a plethora of other tech companies (fun fact: Elon Musk used to work in an office off Castro).
        However, I know Mountain View as a slow town with good food (Clarke's) and nothing to do but the no good.
        Maybe someday I will revisit this topic but after going to school at UC Santa Barbara, I came back home to a city I don't recognize.
        Now, I live in San Francisco.
    </p>

    <p>
        Enough about me though, what most of you have come here for is the code.
        Currently, I am working with Solana, a PoH (proof of history) blockchain which I'm convinced will overtake Ethereum (optimistically).
        My knowledge in the crypto space is next to none so over the coming months, I will be documenting my journey as I explore this field.
    </p>

    <p>
        What am I hoping to get out of this all?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well for starters, I hope to look back on this all fondly.
        Every time I look back at my work in the past, it makes me smile to see my naivete and I hope this plays a similar effect.
        I can only hope that looking back I will be in an expert in whatever it is I have explored.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm also hoping this serves as a learning opportunity for me to develop a blog.
        The structure of the blog. The writing of the material. The styling of the pages. I want it all.
    </p>

    <p>
        And last but not least, to whoever is reading this: I hope you find something in these words.
        Whether knowledge or comfort it does not matter to me, I only wish for the best.
    </p>

    <p>
        I haven't really been paying attention at all to this movie, so I'm going to sign off.
        I'm also trying to get my first PR into the Solana codebase so TTFN.
